/*
 * linear2ulaw() - Convert a linear PCM value to u-law
 *
 * In order to simplify the encoding process, the original linear magnitude
 * is biased by adding 33 which shifts the encoding range from (0 - 8158) to
 * (33 - 8191). The result can be seen in the following encoding table:
 *
 *	Biased Linear Input Code	Compressed Code
 *	------------------------	---------------
 *	00000001wxyza			000wxyz
 *	0000001wxyzab			001wxyz
 *	000001wxyzabc			010wxyz
 *	00001wxyzabcd			011wxyz
 *	0001wxyzabcde			100wxyz
 *	001wxyzabcdef			101wxyz
 *	01wxyzabcdefg			110wxyz
 *	1wxyzabcdefgh			111wxyz
 *
 * Each biased linear code has a leading 1 which identifies the segment
 * number. The value of the segment number is equal to 7 minus the number
 * of leading 0's. The quantization interval is directly available as the
 * four bits wxyz.  * The trailing bits (a - h) are ignored.
 *
 * Ordinarily the complement of the resulting code word is used for
 * transmission, and so the code word is complemented before it is returned.
 *
 * For further information see John C. Bellamy's Digital Telephony, 1982,
 * John Wiley & Sons, pps 98-111 and 472-476.
